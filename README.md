## Supported Content Types

The extension works best with:
- News articles
- Blog posts
- Documentation pages
- Long-form content
- Academic papers
- Research papers
- Tutorial articles

## Privacy & Security

- **Your API key is stored locally** in your browser's extension storage
- **No data is sent to our servers** - communication is directly between your browser and OpenAI
- **Page content is only processed when you click the summary button**
- **Summaries are not stored** - they're generated fresh each time

## Troubleshooting

### Extension not working?
- Make sure you've entered a valid OpenAI API key
- Check that you have credits in your OpenAI account
- Try refreshing the page and clicking the summary button again

### No summary button visible?
- The button only appears on pages with substantial text content
- Try scrolling down - the button appears after content is detected
- Some websites may block content scripts - this is a browser security feature

### API errors?
- Verify your OpenAI API key is correct
- Check your OpenAI account has available credits
- Some pages may have content that's too long - try shorter articles
